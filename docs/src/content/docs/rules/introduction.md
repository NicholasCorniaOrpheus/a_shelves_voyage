# What is the game about?

A Shelves Voyage is a game about discovery, plurality, and unexpected journeys designed for researchers and librarians wishing to unchain the potential of knowledge graphs in their practice.
During a game session, the players are encouraged to reconsider their viewpoint on entities and concepts related to their research field, or catalogue, through a collaborative, and sometimes adversarial, creation of a knowledge graph of entities and properties.

We have introduced some randomness in the process to drive players outside their intellectual comfort zones, to explore the possibilities of unbeaten tracks, opening to the marvel of possibilities of ars combinatoria. Furthermore, the game is suited for researchers and librarians willing to think in semantic triples, according to the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and explore the possibilities
provided by Linked Open Data and knowledge graphs.

This small game wishes to accustom in a fun and engaging way the ones who dare to understand the potential of these new technologies for the Humanities and the Arts.
